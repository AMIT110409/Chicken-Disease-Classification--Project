# Chicken-Disease-Classification--Project

he Chicken Disease Classification project is a machine learning project that aims to classify chicken diseases based on images of chicken feces. The project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the images. The CNN is trained on a dataset of images of chicken feces that have been labeled with the corresponding disease.

The project is still under development, but it has already achieved some promising results. The CNN has been able to correctly classify over 90% of the images in the test set. The project is still being evaluated, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for poultry farmers.

The project is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/krishnaik06/Chicken-Disease-Classification-Projects

The project uses the following Python libraries:

TensorFlow: TensorFlow is a popular open-source machine learning library.
Keras: Keras is a high-level API for TensorFlow that makes it easy to build and train CNNs.
Pillow: Pillow is a Python library for image processing.
The project is divided into the following steps:

Data preparation: The first step is to prepare the data. This involves downloading the dataset of images of chicken feces and labeling the images with the corresponding disease.
Model training: The next step is to train the CNN. This is done by feeding the CNN the images from the dataset and letting it learn to classify the images.
Model evaluation: The final step is to evaluate the model. This is done by feeding the model the images from the test set and seeing how well it can classify the images.
The project is still under development, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool for poultry farmers. The project could help poultry farmers to identify chicken diseases early on, which could help to prevent the spread of disease and improve the health of their chickens.
